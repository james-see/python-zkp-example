### HOW

1. Do `pipenv shell`
2. Do `python3 src/merk.py "ablacklistedimsi"` to validate that that number or string is not in the tree
   1. Note that the double quotes are important, no funny business
   2. ablacklistedimsi string data will validate True as a member, change to something else to get False
3. Do `python3 src/treegen.py to show the example tree as a tree diagram using tkinter and matplotlib`

### THE REST

Who knows. The dude abides.
